# British Airways Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews and understanding buying behavior for British Airways. The analysis includes:

- **Scraping and analyzing customer review data** to uncover key insights.
- **Sentiment analysis** to determine customer sentiment and trends.
- **Building a predictive model** to identify factors that influence booking behavior.

---

## Key Highlights

1. **Web Scraping**
   - Customer reviews were scraped from relevant sources to gather a rich dataset for analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to categorize customer sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Developed a machine learning model to analyze factors influencing customer booking behavior.
